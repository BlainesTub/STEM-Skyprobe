# STEM-Skyprobe
The code for our senior STEM Skyprobe Project. 

This repository contains all of the relevant files needed to install and run the project, and includes:

* Separate Arduino Sketches for both launching and testing the probe
* 2 complete Fritzing sketches with all the necessary wiring laid out in the correct colors for both testing on a breadboard and launch. 
* A custom Sensor Calibration library that makes calibration of the sensors easy with all the values located in one file

There are youtube tutorials that are on the way, as well as a full text guide on this document to assist with installation.
